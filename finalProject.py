  In the middle is a \'couch\' with two end tables on each side.  One end table has a lamp on it, while the other has a lantern.  To the left is a large overstuffed arm chair.
  There is a coffee table in front of the couch and an old wood grained RCA \'television\' sitting on the floor in front of the coffee table.  On top of the television was a betamax player
  and several betamax tapes.  Framed pictures decorate the walls on every side."""
  #Description of kitchen
  kitchenDescription = """The kitchen was surprisingly one of the cleaner rooms in the mansion.  I guess the owner was not much of a cook?  The interior was vintage 70s.  Wood \'cabinets\' with old ivory pull knobs.
  There was an oven, range top stove, and refrigerator...all avocado green.  The sink still has a few glasses in it, but nothing else seemed to be out of place.
  The floor was linoleum and there was an old \'floor mat\' in front of the kitchen sink.  The dirtiest thing in the whole room was an old microwave sitting on the counter.
  This was obviously the owner\'s appliance of choice, lol.  By the far wall under the window was a small table with a single solitary chair.  Guess he didn\'t entertain too many guests?"""

  On the left side of the porch is an old rocking \'chair\' with a small table next to it.  On the table is an ashtray and a coaster.  To the right of the rocking chair is the front door of the mansion painted a bright red color.
  Beneath the door is a mat that says \"Welcome\"."""
  #Description of Graveyard
  graveyardDescription = """The graveyard is small and sits on a hill adjacent to the mansion.  The \'tombstone\'s are laid out in a haphazard manner.  It appears to be a family cemetery for the Adam\'s family.
  Some of the dates go back to the 1700s.   The cemetery suffers from obvious years of neglect as many of the headstones are in disrepair and the weeds and ivy are overgrown.
  In the middle of the graveyard is an old oak tree that stretches far above the entire cemetery."""

  A large sign stands above the building with giant letters spelling out D-I-N-E-R.  You wonder if the place is even in business.  Oh, well.  Only one way to find out.  You head inside.
  The appearance inside the diner is only slightly more upkept than the outside.  The plastic material on the booths and barstools is cracked.  The paint on the walls is faded and peeling in places.
  Behind the counter is an older woman with Edith on her nametag.  You approach the counter."""
